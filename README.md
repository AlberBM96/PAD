# Official Pedestrian Awarenes Dataset repository.

Welcome, amigo!

This repository contains the code I developed as part of my Bachelor's Project, which is called "Development of an intelligent system to detect and predict pedestrians' intentions". It is an integrated suite of tools to process videos, work with bounding boxes and make behavior-related stuff.

Here you will also find the files resulting from the behavioral analysis I performed in that project.
